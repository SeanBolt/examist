The problem is with exam papers.Problem StatementThe online interface for accessing exam papers here in NUI Galway is dated to say the least. The interface is reminiscent of user interfaces created for the web in the early 90s and has not been updated since. It's slow, doesn't support any features you'd expect from the system and goes down often (even during exam time!). It even uses iframes.Another problem with exam papers is that we, the students, don't have solutions to the questions and it's a pointless exercise doing exam questions if you don't know whether you are correct or not. Often someone has to correct your work or you compare notes with a peer.And the worst of all the problems is that the learning is isolated. In the information age, learning should be open to all. With the current system, the information is stuck in old formats and copy books.\n\n\n\nSolutionThe purpose of this project is to create an online platform where students can learn about their courses and focus on the topics covered in exam papers. It will allow students to adequately prepare themselves for an exam in a focused manner and enable them to review their performance. Students can learn from the tested course material with answers from their peers instead of working alone, blind.The platform will host the exam papers questions, solutions and notes for all courses within NUI Galway (and hopefully any institution in the future). Students won't have to use the current system with it's shortcomings. Exploring exam papers should be breeze, not a pain."},"research/downloading-papers.html":{"url":"research/downloading-papers.html","title":"Downloading Exam Papers","keywords":"","body":"1. Research1.1 Downloading PapersBefore work on the exam papers could begin, data on the paper was required. One of the core problems this application was built to fix is the extremely poor accessibility of exam papers online via the student portal. The interface is outdated, clunky and slow. It goes down entirely for a 30 minute period of time daily for \"maintenance\" which is very frustrating for students especially during exam time. With this in consideration, manual downloading of exam papers was not an option.CoursesTo build our database of all courses and papers available, a starting point was needed to serve as the foundations for the extraction. This starting point was the list of course category codes (the prefix before any course code e.g. \"MA\" in MA207) provided in the contents of the dropdown menu within the search from on the online portal. It provided data which looked like:name,code\n\"Accountancy\",AY\n\"Anaesthetics\",AE\n\"Anatomy\",AN\n\"Anatomy / Physiology\",AP\n\"Ancient Classics\",AC\n\"Applied Computing & Information Technology\",CI\nThe project now had a list of all possible course categories from the online portal, now it needed to obtain a list of individual courses and their papers. To complete this task, the handy (but not particularly useful) feature of the search function on the online portal was exploited:Module/Subject Code - A module code (e.g., MA100), part of a code (e.g., FR2% for all second year French modules), or an entire subject area as defined by the first part of each module code (e.g., PI for Philosophy).The search term could contain a wildcard \"%\" which would expand our query to find related modules within a category, similar to the SQL LIKE function. This meant the scraper could input \"MA%\" into the search and return all papers for  courses with the prefix \"MA\" in order, for example \"MA100\" and \"MA101\". Queries like these would match all courses with the prefix thus all papers for those courses which result in huge collections of papers (\"MA%\" return 1,456 papers).Unfortunately (however understandable from a performance point of view), the system had a limit of returned results from any query. A maximum of 500 papers would be returned from each query. This forced things to be more complicated on the scraping end.The portal's limit on results forced the scaper to decompose it's query into the search box to return less that 500 results. To decompose the query, it simply added another character in front of the category code to reduce the search scope and then repeated the search with the wildcard. For example, \"MA%\" would be converted to \"MAA%\". Once the query was decomposed enough, it would cycle through the characters alphabetically including digits \"MAA%\", \"MAB%\", .. \"MA9%\", \"MA0%\" until results were obtained from the portal.Finally, results were returned from the portal but would be trapped within a poorly formatted HTML table. A HTML parser called BeautifulSoup for python was used to load up the HTML and perform DOM selections and data extraction. Each table row represented a paper and each cell had information about the paper. This extraction method was fragile because of the inconsistent HTML returned but the only option available. Some shaky logic were used to describe the paper such as the presence of an anchor element within a table cell told the scraper if the paper was available online or not.Once all the data was extracted from each search result page for every module category, it allowed the project to build a database of modules and their papers. Links to the PDF contents could be derived from the data by using the URL pattern provided:https://www.mis.nuigalway.ie/papers_public/\n    {year}/{module_category}/{year}_{module_code}_{sitting}_{period}.PDF\nThe scraper managed to collect 19,634 papers across 2,904 courses, completely scanning the portal in less than 15 minutes. This newly collected database allowed the project to stay away from the online portal and not use up unnecessary server resources or perform useless requests."},"research/parsing-papers.html":{"url":"research/parsing-papers.html","title":"Parsing Exam Papers","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Parsing the Exam PapersOne of the biggest technical feats of this project was parsing the exam papers. The exam papers from NUI Galway were all stored in PDF format which made it a particulary hard task to approach.PDF FormatThe PDF format specification is 22 years old and is entirely backwards compatible. That means any features supported in version 1.0 of the specification are still supported the current version, 1.7. This is good for users of the PDF format because even the oldest PDFs will still work however not for developers who want to use the contents of the PDF. The format is full of old concepts, quirks and dead techniques that have plagued anyone attempting to peek under the hood. Luckily for this project, the PDF format was never accessed directly but through libraries in Python. Some libraries reviewed:PDFMiner - A full suite of amazing tools for parsing everything about a PDF however documentation is next to nil which makes it's a non-viable candidate.\n\nSlate - A very simple library that will load the PDF and extract the text (based on PDFMiner).\n\nSome external tools were also tested:pdftotext - Command line tool to extract the text contents of a PDF by the Poppler project.\n\npdftohtml - Another command line tool that converts a PDF to HTML (or XML).\n\nTesseract - An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library to extract the contents of the PDF.\n\nHowever easy it was to access the data, one fact remains: PDF is only about presentation, not structure. The outputted data was not easy to parse. Content extracted via the libraries and tools was unstructured and unformatted. Tables, math formula, question indexes, titles and event text decoration would all corrupt the output.Example of the output produced by `pdftotext` with Math formulas.\n\n\n\nParsing the PDF contentsStructure of the exam paperBefore starting to extract the data from the PDF, the structure of the underlying data must be understood. From tests across multiple papers, no consistent structure was observed over the exam papers. Below are some observations of consistencies and inconsistencies between papers.Consistencies between exam papersThe first page in an exam paper described the exam paper itself. It contained metadata on the years, examiners, lecturers and classes.\n\nEach page in an exam paper had a page number in the footer.\n\nInconsistencies between exam papersExam paper metadata did not have any discernable structure and the labels could appear in any order or not at all.\n\nExam questions could appear indexed numerical, alphabetical and using roman numerals. e.g. a, b, c or i, ii, iii.\n\nExam question indices did following any formatting style. Indices could be any of the following form: (a), (a.), (1)., [i], iii., B., 1., Q1., Question 2, or just the index itself, c.\n\nSome exam papers used sections while others did not e.g. Section A.\n\nSome exam papers displayed marks after each question while others did not.\n\nExam papers displayed marks using square brackets [10] or parenthesis (10). Some also included the label marks.\n\nSub-questions and multiple-choice answers would be indexed in the same format and style. e.g. 1. 1. instead of 1. a..\n\nSub-questions and multiple-choice answers wouldn't be indexed at all.\n\nSome exam questions were indexed improperly or ordered wrong. e.g. 1., 2., 4., 5., 6..\n\nExam papers could be written by two or more people who each chose they own style of formatting. These exam papers had multiple, inconsistent styles between questions.\n\nExtract indices with a Context Free GrammarThe main attempt at parsing the contents of the PDF to extract the exam paper's structure and all it's questions was via a Context Free Grammar (CFG). The grammar was used to extract the indices of each question and therefore build a usuable representation of the paper structure from the indices. The CFG was created using the Pyparsing library that allowed for constructing complex grammars using simple syntax.The grammar was constructed to extract all the indices from the paper. It was designed to be as loose as possible to include all the types of indices (alphabetical, numerical, roman) and all their formats (square brackets, parenthesis). Whitespace and sections were also accounted for within the grammar.import pyparsing as pp\n\n# The exam paper CFG\n_ = (pp.White(exact=1) | pp.LineEnd() | pp.LineStart()).suppress()\n__ = pp.White().suppress()\n___ = pp.Optional(__)\n____ = pp.Optional(_)\n\n# Define tokens for numerical, alpha and roman indices\n# Max two digits for numerical indices because lecturers aren't psychopaths\nindex_digit = pp.Word(pp.nums, max=2)\\\n    .setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: [Index(\"decimal\", int(t[0]))])(\"[0-9]\") \n\nindex_alpha = pp.Word(pp.alphas, exact=1)\\\n    .setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: [Index(\"alpha\", t[0])])(\"[a-z]\")\n\nindex_roman = pp.Word(\"ivx\")\\ # We only support 1-100 roman numerals\n    .setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: [Index(\"roman\", t[0])])(\"[ivx]\") \n\nindex_type = (index_digit | index_roman | index_alpha)(\"index\")\n\n# Define token for (\"Question\" / \"Q\") + \".\"\nquestion = (pp.CaselessLiteral(\"Question\") + pp.Optional(\".\"))(\"question\")\n\n# Define tokens for formatted indices e.g [a], (1), ii. etc.\nindex_dotted = (\n    index_type + pp.Literal(\".\").suppress()\n).setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: t[0].setNotation(\"dotted\"))\n\nindex_round_brackets = (\n    pp.Optional(pp.Literal(\"(\")).suppress() + index_type + \\\n    pp.Literal(\")\").suppress()\n).setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: t[0].setNotation(\"round\"))\n\nindex_square_brackets = (\n    pp.Literal(\"[\").suppress() + index_type + \\\n    pp.Literal(\"]\").suppress()\n).setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: t[0].setNotation(\"square\"))\n\nindex_question = (\n    pp.Word(\"qQ\", exact=1).suppress() + \\\n    pp.Optional(\".\").suppress() + index_type + \\\n    pp.Optional(\".\").suppress()\n).setParseAction(lambda s, l, t: t[0].setNotation(\"question\"))\n\n# Define final index token with optional \n# question_index token before formatted index\nqindex = (\n    # Whitespace is required before each index \n    # (e.g. \"hello world.\" the d. would be take for an index)\n    _ + \\\n    # Optional \"Question.\" before\n    pp.Optional(question + ___).suppress() + \\\n    # The index\n    (index_question | index_dotted | \\\n        index_round_brackets | index_square_brackets) + \\\n    # Required whitespace *after* index\n    _\n)\n\n# Define a section header\nsection = (\n    pp.CaselessKeyword(\"Section\").suppress() + \\\n    __ + index_type + _\n).setParseAction(\n    lambda s, l, t: [t[0].section()]\n)(\"section\")\n\n# Entry point for the parser\nentry = section ^ qindex\nThe grammar was made up of a set of tokens. Each token is made up of literals (strings) or other tokens. The gramar had three tokens to define an index itself: index_digit, index_alpha and index_roman and a final index_type that combined the three to match all. It then defined three more tokens for the index formatting style in that wrapped the index_type, one for parenthesis (( index_type )), square brackets ([ index_type ]) and the dotted form (index_type .). Those style forms were then combined to create qindex token which also accounted for an optional prefix of Q or Question in the index. For something to be an qindex, it had to have whitespace before and after the matched token. This was to prevent matching numbers or symbols mid-question. The second last token then was a section which combined the literal \"Section\" and index_type. Finally, the entry point for the grammar was to match either a section or qindex.When the grammar was run on the input text from the PDF, it iterated over each character in the text and checked if that character matched the entry token, it ran the parser action for each token. These parser actions are defined using the method setParseAction on the rule and passing a lambda function with parameters containing information about the matching rules. Any return value from those actions replace the match from that rule. Also notice in the grammar above, some rules output could be surpressed by calling the surpress method which dropped that rule from the match.The parser actions for the above tokens created Index objects for index_type which attributes were modified as they matched other rules. Eventually, the results returned an array of Indexs with contained the index type (alpha, decimal, roman), the formatting style (dotted, round, square) and whether is was a section or prefixed with a Question.There were some major caveats to the parser:Sentences ending with a digit and period are picked up as indices.\n\nGeneral formatting or referencing another question within a question are picked up as indices.\n\nSome formatted math are picked up as indices e.g. x * (y).\n\nSome mark forms at the end of questions are picked up as indicies.\n\nThe PDF format usually botched the whitespace from the text leaving some indices without enclosing whitespace and therefore not included as an indice.\n\nExample output: The matching indices on a real exam paper.\n\n\n\nCreating the question treeThe grammar was useful for extracting the indices however the data returned from the grammar unprocessed is useless. It's the content between the indices, the questions, is what the project is after.The exam papers are based on a heirarchy, with usually three to six top level questions and many sub-questions. The best data structure for this type is obviously a tree. Once the parsing is completed and we have a list of our index tokens, we need to put them into this tree.index = token[0] # The incoming index\n\nlogging.info(\"0. Handling index %r\" % index)\n\n# If the container is the paper, just push the question\nif len(index_stack) == 0:\n    logging.info(\"1.

Add the\n        # question after the found container.\n        if parent_index.isNext(index):\n            logging.info(\"1.2.1.1 Index in sequence, pushing into stack.\")\n            index_stack = index_stack[:n]\n            question_stack = question_stack[:n]\n            question = push()\n        else:\n            logging.info(\"1.2.1.2 Index not in sequence, ignoring\")\n            continue\n\n    # If we encounter a new type of index and \n    # it's not the start of a new list, we can just discard \n    # it (it's probably marks). However if the previous index is \n    # a section, we can just continue. \n    elif index.i == 1 or last_index.is_section: \n        logging.info(\"1.2.2 Pushing new question %r.\" % index)\n        question = push()\n    else:\n        logging.info(\"1.2.3 New index value not first in sequence, ignoring.\")\n        continue\n\n# Save the text between the previous indice and the current\nif last_question != None:\n    last_question.set_content(None, pages[marker:start])\n    last_question = None\n    marker = end\nelif marker == 0:\n    marker = end\n\nlast_question = question\nThe implementation of the tree construction algorithm.\n\n\n\nThis algorithm would approach the tree creation using a stack. The stack contains all the questions in the heirarchy for the current index i.e. the tail of the stack is the parent of the current index (if appropriate). The above is the content of the loop and performs the following checks for each token.For each index:If the stack is empty, this must be a top level index. Push to stack with contents.\n\nIf the tail question's (in the stack) index if of a different type to index, push to stack. Assume sub-question.\n\nIf the tail question's index if of the same type as index push the current question and contents to the tail question's parent as sibling of the tail question.\n\nOther checks are in place for pushing to root level parents (i.e. non-existant) and indexes that are out of sequence to their siblings. The tree builder would also save the contents of each questions to it's index.Section A\n-- 1\n---- i\n------ a\n------ b\n------ c\n------ d\n------ e\n---- ii\n...\n-- 2\n---- i\n---- ii\n---- iii\n------ a\n------ b\n------ c\n------ d\n---- iv\n-- 3\n---- i\n---- ii\n---- iii\n---- iv\n---- v\n-- 4\n---- i\n---- ii\n------ a\n------ b\n------ c\n------ d\n---- iii\n\n\n\n\n\n0.

Right: The outputted tree without the question content. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResultsThe algorithm was tested on a wide vareity of papers to best encapsulate the variations in formatting. Courses related to Math, Chemistry and Engineering were among those tested to ensure the greatest diversity. The output was compared manually and a measure of performance was estimated.The results were poor. The exam papers were just too inconsistent in their formatting and output for it to perform reliably. Many indices were missing the structure of the paper was almost always wrong. This was a disappointing result given the amount of effort put into the algorithm however it forced innovation in other areas to ensure the correct data was collected. Since the CFG method proved fruitless, a smarter system would be required to automatically parse the exam papers accurately. This is where some experimentation with Machine Learning entered the picture.Data collection for Machine LearningIt was clear something smarter was required and going down the route with machine learning, especially since it's used in other parts of the project, seemed like a great option. However, to being learning models and algorithms, the project needed data. It would be impossible to train (never mind test the algorithm) without large amounts of data. Currently, there was no way of collecting the data aside from grinding away at a spreadsheet.In the end, the decision was made to create a user interface to help parse the exam papers. This served two purposes:A quick method of parsing the exam papers while the automated system is being constructed.\n\nA method of training data collection from the exam papers.\n\nBenefits of the user interfaceThe user interface (UI) is useful to help collect data in a consistent manner by forcing a schema on the collected data.\n\nAllows for crowd-sourcing the contents of the papers. \n\nLot faster than manually opening the exam paper's PDF file and collecting data in a spreadsheet.\n\nThe UI does have it's drawbacks however. The process is not automated being the greatest. This makes it slow and tedious in comparasion. Fortunately for the project however, once the data has been collected from the exam paper, that's it complete. There is a finite set data and it's just a matter of which method is going to win the race."},"design/architecture.html":{"url":"design/architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"2. Design2.1 ArchitectureThe project's architecture can be separated into two sections, the frontend and the backend.FrontendThe frontend of the application describes the user facing aspect of the application. All user interaction with the software takes place via this interface.The front facing aspect of this project is a large Javascript application based on React and Redux with many other modules. It is entirely dynamic and never loads any HTML or CSS aside from the initial index.html page load (which is only 15 lines long). The application itself has many internal components itself which are detailed more in the Frontend section of the Implementation chapter but a brief overview:An internal URL router for the view layer.\n\nA single, immutable, global application state object.\n\nComposable component based UI split into \"smart\" and \"dumb\" components.\n\nFrameworks & LibrariesReact - The library behind the User Interface portion of the application.\n\nRedux - For managing the global application state and updates.\n\nReact Router - The applications internal router for the view layer.\n\nIt also happened that on Feb. 28, 2016 (months after choosing the technology set), an article published titled \"State of the Art Javascript in 2016\" follows exactly the same choices for technologies as the project.Decision processPicking a library to base your Javascript application is not easy. The ecosystem is constantly changing and there are a plethora of libraries released backed by the biggest names in technology which makes it a hard choice. The decision to go with React and Redux was moreso for the learning experience, rather than a technology fit for the application. On a personal level, after much review of other frameworks and their communities, I feel as though React and the concepts behind Redux will be the outright leader in the frontend world for years to come.\n\n\n\nBackendThe backend of the application is what the frontend interfaces with. It's an exposed REST API that sends and receives JSON. The language powering it is Python and the framework behind it is Flask. Flask is a web simple framework but is also feature complete. It has fantastic documentation along with a large, active community surrounding the project. SQL Alchemy is ORM and database interface for the application.To power the database side of things, PostgreSQL was chosen because it is best in class for RDBMS systems. Postgres has world class product and documentation which is all entirely open source.Flask is unsuitable to handle large volumes of traffic and requires a load balancer to sit in front of the users. To balance the load and also serve static content, Nginx is deployed in front of the Python application.Frameworks & LibrariesFlask - Flask is a small Python web framework with a large feature set.\n\nSQL Alchemy - A fully featured, best-in-class Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). \n\nMarshmallow - A library for serialising, deserialising and validating data.\n\nScikit Learn - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.\n\nDecision ProcessThe decision to choose Python as the main language for the backend was not an easy one. I personally have worked almost exclusively in Node.js for my API requirements to date and it would have fit perfectly with the Javascript frontend however I wanted to challenge myself. By using other frameworks and languages, you gain new perspective on things and can better understand how to learn new technologies. Python also has extensive collection of libraries for machine learning (ML) and data mining aspect which helped make the decision easier because they would come in handy for the ML parts of the application."},"design/database.html":{"url":"design/database.html","title":"Database","keywords":"","body":"2.2 DatabaseThe database ER diagram.\n\n\n\nBrowse the database structure online.OverviewThe database uses a relational model and has 16 tables in total (17 including the table created by the migration tool, Alembic). A relational model was chosen based up the type of data to be inserted into the database. The entire database (aside from alembic_version) is constructed by SQL Alchemy. No manual schema creation SQL needs to be written.

In code, it implements some polymorphism trickery and dynamic insert queries however in database terms, it's relatively simple. For the sake of clarity, it is understood that each model in the database could be considered an entity however not all implement the entity inheritance model. This is SQL Alchemy terminology and is explained in the Model section in the Implementation chapter. Entities in the entity inheritance model are things (for lack of a better word) that obtain their identifier from the entity table.Each entity's identifier column (always named id) is a foreign key to the id column in the entity table. Anytime a new entity is created, a new row in the entity table is created and linked back to the type of class. The type (or discriminator) column of the entity table specifies how the ORM should JOIN the entity table to load it's actual data. For example, take the Question entity which has a type of \"question\". Any queries related to that entity join onto the question table to return the question data.The project uses the Entity Inheritance Model to allow for polymorphic operations on different types of data. These operations are liking and commenting on different things. By using this system, it allows the server to create a single comment table instead of multiple many-to-many relationship tables question_comments, solution_comments and note_comments. With the single table, the API can create a new row in the comment table referencing that entity and let the ORM do all the hard, relationship loading work when querying in the future.Self-referential ListsAnother complex configuration, this time in both code and database terms, is the self-referential lists. Also called adjacency lists, these are in essence what most graph databases do at a most basic level. It allows applications to build trees of relationships from one item in the table to another item in the same table.In this project, both the comment and question table use the adjacency list configuration. Both use cases are identical: nesting. Each question can have many sub-questions which can also have sub-questions. This can create a deeply nested tree structure that needs to be represented in the database. To store these relationships, each question has a parent_id column which is a foreign key to the id column in the same table, question. The foreign key ensure the data integrity and also helps avoid breaking parent-child chains by deleting parents who still have children creating orphan questions. The loading techniques for Self-referential lists is described in the Models section in the Implementation chapter.\n    \n    Both the entity inheritance model and the self-referential list systems in the comment table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data and LoginThe user login system for the application is pretty basic in that it meets expectations for handling sensitive user data such as passwords. Each user has a salt and password column that contain a secure hash of their password. These hashes are created when the user signs up and only change when the user updates their password. These are required fields for the user table as well as their email, which also has a unique constraint.User logins are saved in the sessions table. Each session has a unique hash that is created each time the user logs in. This token is passed to the user, saved on their client and used to identify their sessions. It acts like a temporal API key. The table configuration is again fairly simplistic for the current needs of the application and only stores the hash, timestamps and whether it is active or not. The plan for the future is to track page views along with all user actions and attach to the specific user's sessions. This will help prevent malicious activity and spam.A more detailed explanation of how user data and sessions are handled is in the Authentication section of the Implementation chapter.Revision systemSince the question and solution content is both open to anyone to edit and critical to the experience of the application, it is important to protect the data from abuse. With the manual editor of the exam papers, the contents of the papers are entirely crowd-sourced. As a consequence of crowd-sourcing, there will be users and spammers who will corrupt some valid question data malicious intent. To account for this, the application has implemented a wiki style revision system where any changes to the question or solution content is stored, in its entirety, in the revision table. The revision table has a TEXT column called content which, as labelled, contains the content being stored. To store what is the current revision of the question, a question_revision table maps the question to the current revision.Note: As of writing, the revision system has not yet migrated to the entity inheritance model and is in it's current state, only traking revisions for question content. This is legacy behaviour that has not been updated to work with solutions.SimilarityThe final item worth noting about the database is the similarity system. It contains information on how similar questions are with each other. Currently, the scope of a question's similarity is to any questions within the same course however that could well be expanded to the entire corpus which might yield interesting results. The similar_questions table stores this information by referencing the two questions, question_id and similar_question_id alongside a similarity float. With this configuration, some interesting queries such to retrieve the similar of questions are possible. For example, to retrieve the most popular questions in a course:SELECT question_id, sum(similarity) AS similarity FROM similar_questions as sq\n    INNER JOIN question ON (sq.question_id = question.id)\n    INNER JOIN paper ON (question.paper_id = paper.id)\n    INNER JOIN course ON (paper.course_id = course.id)\n    WHERE similarity > 0.6 AND \n        sq.question_id != sq.similar_question_id AND\n        course.code = 'CT422' \n    GROUP BY question.id\n    ORDER BY similarity DESC;\n"},"design/api.html":{"url":"design/api.html","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"2.3 APIThe API for the application was based upon RESTful architecture. Communication between the client and server was based upon the JSON format.Standard ResponsesThe API follows a standard for three types of responses: error, success and data.

The error field is just a boolean denoting an error has occurred while message and meta both describe the error. The meta object can contain anything and is usually contains extra data to display to the user to give a more detailed error report.> 400 BAD REQUEST\n{\n    \"error\": true,\n    \"message\": \"Invalid data in request.\",\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"field\": \"email\"\n    }\n}\nSuccess responseSometimes requests to the server perform actions and required no more of a response than a simple \"Yes, the action was completed.\" For this, the API has a standard success response of the form below.> 200 OK\n{\n    \"success\": true\n}\nData responseThe data response is more loose in what form it takes as a response. The data schema does not follow any pattern like the success and error responses however it must return a 200 OK status code. Usually, however not enforced, the top level keys denote entities and the type of entity is used as the key. An example response from the API:> 200 OK\n{\n  \"course\": {\n    \"code\": \"CT422-1\",\n    \"id\": 2819,\n    \"institution_id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"Modern Information Management\",\n    \"papers\": [\n      3671,\n      3672,\n      ...\n      3685,\n      3686\n    ]\n  }\n}\n"},"design/ui.html":{"url":"design/ui.html","title":"UI","keywords":"","body":"2.4 User InterfaceThe User Interface (UI) of the application is built using React. React is a state of the art abstraction that works on top of, but not limited to, the Document Object Model (DOM) of the browser. React introduces a new syntax called JSX where you can declaratively construct you application's view using XML (or HTML) within the Javascript (it's not as bad as it sounds):function PaperLink(props) {\n    const { course, paper } = props; \n    const link = `/course/${course.code}/paper/` + \n        `${paper.year_start}/${paper.period}`;\n\n    return (\n        \n            \n                \n                    { paper.year_start }\n                    { capitalize(paper.period) }\n                \n            \n        \n    );\n}\nExample of a real component within the app using React and JSX.\n\n\n\nComponentsThe entire UI of the application is based on components. A component is a small piece of the interface that follows the Single Responsibility Principle (Hunt, 2016). The component should only do one thing and when it grows large, it should be decomposed into smaller components. Components represent every part of the user interface from the buttons to comment forms to page footers.Outline of top level components within the Course component.\n\n\n\nSingle, Global, Immutable StateNormally with React, each component has it's own state that it can update or modify by itself. This is useful for handling small user interactions like keyboard input or mouse clicks however within the scope of the entire app, local state can be dangerous. Local state allows the application to take on an infinite state space when composing the components. This is bad for testing and building user interfaces because it's impossible to ensure every state is handled correctly. To avoid this, the project uses a library called Redux.Pure UIRedux, at first, is hard to grasp but is logical when understood. Redux forces the application state to be held in one single, global, immutable object. This state, is then the sole source of truth for the app and defines the view. It can't be stressed enough, the state defines the view.\n\n\n\nA useful analogy to help understand what the state defines the view means is to take any black and white image. The state of that image is the pixel data which is represented by an array of 1 and 0s. This state is then passed to an image renderer who will produce a static image. What's important to note here is that given the same pixel state, the renderer will always produce the same image no matter what.\n\n\n\nWith Redux, we take this concept and apply it to our user interface. The the metaphors terms, the application state is the pixel array and the React app is the image renderer. Given an application state, the renderer will always render the same view. This is what it means by the state defines the view.\n\n\n\nOnce this concept is understood, the next logical question is how to modify the state to change the app. This brings us onto our next two concepts, actions and reducers.ActionsActions are how the state of the app is modified. They communicate to the state that something has occurred and pass any information that the state needs in order to update in response to that action. This concept may seem confusing at first however it becomes clear when we look at how reducers work. For now, think of an action as a simple, atomic object with a type that uniquely identifies that specific action:{\n    type: \"OPEN_PAPER\",\n    payload: {\n        paper_id: 34\n    }\n}\nReducersReducers are how we construct the final state representation before it is passed to the view. As the name suggests, reducers work on the same way as the familiar \"reduce\" concept by taking a value and reducing it to a single value. The reducer takes the state of the application and reduces it in response to an action.For example, when the above action OPEN_PAPER is dispatched to the state, the reducer receives it and returns a new state in response to that action. This means updating the view to display the paper with ID of 34.function paperViewReducer(state = {}, action) {\n    return { current_paper: action.payload.paper_id };\n}\nThis new, reduced state is then passed to the view for rendering. It's extremely important to the understanding of Redux is that the state can only change in response to actions. Reducers also have to be pure functions. A pure function is a function that's value is determined solely on the parameters passed. This characteristic is important to reducers to ensure that the view is always defined by actions and actions alone. With this background in mind, hopefully you will understand Redux's three principles (Abramov, 2016) (copied verbatim from the documentation):Single source of truth.The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.\nState is read-only.The only way to mutate the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.\nChanges are made with pure functions.To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.\nApplication State & ActionsThe application state is defined by the reducers and actions in the model directory. The reducers are collected at runtime time and combined to created to reduce to a single state object. Whenever an action is dispatched, it is passed to each reducer which processes the action and returns it's new state. Each reducer's new state is combined until the full application state is formed.Async actionsAsynchronous actions are tricky in Redux because they require two actions. One to tell the state the async task has started (display loading symbols etc.) and another telling the task is complete with the data returned (display fetched content). This is done for each network request within the app. This functionality spawned the now published library redux-pending on npm authored by myself.The redux pending library takes a Javascript Promise, dispatches an action to the state to notify the promise has begun execution and again when the promise has completed execution with the return value as the payload of the action.Smart & Dumb ComponentsNot all the components need to talk to the global application state. In fact, most never communicate or touch it whatsoever. These are called \"dumb\" components. They render what data is passed to them and no more. Dumb components can be placed anywhere within the app and always function the same. These components should never handle user actions, they should pass that responsibility to the parent component by way of passing event handlers.\"Smart\" components are components that communicate and mutate the state based on actions. Smart component connect and listen to state changes and update the view accordingly. They are made up of a collection of dumb components and pass state to these components for rendering."},"implementation/project-structure.html":{"url":"implementation/project-structure.html","title":"Project Structure","keywords":"","body":"3.

It powers the API the frontend communicates with to run the application.ModelsOverall, there are 14 models at the current time of writing. The names of each model are pretty much self explanatory. For a more in-depth look at the relationship configurations between the models, see the Database section of the Design chapter.comment.py\n\ncourse.py\n\nentity.py\n\ninstitution.py\n\nlike.py\n\nnote.py\n\npaper.py\n\npaper_download.py\n\nquestion.py\n\nrevision.py\n\nsession.py\n\nsolution.py\n\nuser.py\n\nA model inherits from the SQL Alchemy declarative base. This is the base that communicates with the ORM to create the tables and essentially notify it that the model exists. A model also has a __tablename__ which describes the table where the model will be stored. To construct a model, attributes are added mapping the column names in the database to the attributes in the class.class Note(Entity, Serializable):\n    __tablename__ = \"note\"\n    id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\"entity.id\"), primary_key=True)\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\"user.id\"))\n    question_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(\"question.id\"))\n    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)\n    updated_at = Column(DateTime, onupdate=current_timestamp())\n    description = Column(Text)\n\n    question = relationship(\"Question\", foreign_keys=question_id)\n    user = relationship(\"User\", backref=\"notes\")\nThe Note model from the Server\n\n\n\nRelationships can be easily created using the relationship function which can also created back references on the model linked. ForeignKeys and other modifiers are all made extremely simple.\n\n\n\nSerialisation & DeserialisationThe entity serialisation and deserialisation was a particularly tough problem to solve. Python objects are not natively serialisable like the Javascript counter part. On top of that, the attributes on the entities weren't really attributes in the Python sense of the word but were describing attributes for the database.After some searching for some serialisation library, Marshmallow turned up looking the most reliable. Large community with an active repository and good documentation were good signs the project is still alive and well. It also has a nice API for the serialisation and deserialisation (or \"dumping\" and \"loading\" in Marshmallow terminology). To serialise an object, a schema must be defined:modelSchema = marshmallow.Schema({\n    \"name\": fields.Str(),\n    \"age\": fields.Int()\n})\nThis became tedious because a schema had to be created for every model in the application and be update anytime they were changed. This wouldn't do when the schemas were already defined in SQL Alchemy. A schema builder was built that would take the SQL Alchemy model and produce the Marshmallow schema equivalent. The generated schema was then stored in a __schema__ magic attribute on each SQL Alchemy model. This functionality was added to a model whenever it subclassed server.library.model.Serializable (as seen above in the Note model).To complete the new serialisation system, a DynamicJSONEncoder was introduced that subclassed Python's native JSONEncoder. When the DynamicJSONEncoder encountered any SQL Alchemy object that was serialisable, it would return the serialised result instead of letting Python handle it natively. The new encoder was then handed of to Flask as the default JSON encoder. The dynamic encoder allowed for simply returning SQL Alchemy models in the API and the result would be converted to JSON. Even collections were automatically handled and some sensitive fields such as password could be marked hidden.@app.route(\"/paper/\")\ndef get_papers(code):\n    papers = db.session.query(Paper).filter(Course.code == code).all()\n\n    return respond({ \"papers\": papers })\nEntity inheritance Model LoadingOne of the would-be complicated aspects of the server was greatly simplified by SQL Alchemy, the Entity Inheritance Model. This model is explained fully in the Database section of the Design chapter however it did not explain the loading techniques.Using the above Note as the example, we'll take it's sister models NoteLink and NoteUpload. The note link is simply a link on the internet that is good learning material for a question which a note upload is an uploaded piece of learning material. Both are extremely similar and only differ in two attributes, the link for the NoteLink and file_path for the NoteUpload. Here is the implementation for the classes:class NoteLink(Note, Serializable):\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        \"polymorphic_identity\": \"note_link\"\n    }\n\n    link = Column(String)\n\nclass NoteUpload(Note, Serializable):\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        \"polymorphic_identity\": \"note_upload\"\n    }\n\n    file_path = Column(String)\nImplementation of the NoteLink and the NoteUpload. Right below, the Note database table.\n\n\n\nSee how both the model's subclass the Note class and both add an extra attribute. SQL alchemy understands this configuration and stores the both attributes in the parent Note table at the cost of normalisation.SQL Alchemy will load the correct classes for each Note object returned from the database. If a row is a note link in the database, SQL Alchemy will return a NoteLink object. The reason it is able to do this is because it picks the class based on it's polymorphic_identity. The note example was picked for a reason because it is doubly inherited. The Note class also inherits from the Entity class which contains a type column that contains stores the polymorphic_identity of the entity. SQL Alchemy will still load the correct class even through two levels of inheritance, at no cost to the programmer. I personally think that is amazing given how little code is required to implement it.Adjacency List LoadingAdjacency list loading was another would-be tricky technique that the ORM handled with ease. SQL Alchemy essentially performs a graph database traversal (in what capacity an RDBMS can allow it) when it loads nested comment threads. The nested relationship allows you to specify join_depth for loading the nested lists and it will issue a query that JOINs the same table join_depth over. For example, the question table, which uses the adjacency list configuration gets joined four times over for monster queries to load the relationships. These joins get even larger when other question relationships are loaded. These queries are highly in-efficient but with the good caching system, it's irrelevant.SELECT question.id AS question_id, entity.id AS entity_id, entity.type AS entity_type,\n    question.paper_id AS question_paper_id, question.parent_id AS question_parent_id,\n    question.created_at AS question_created_at, question.marks AS question_marks, question.index AS\n    question_index,

GET /auth\n    POST /comment/\n     PUT /comment//\n  DELETE /comment//\n     GET /comments/\n     GET /course/\n     PUT /course//index\n     GET /course//paper//\n     GET /course//paper//.html\n    POST /course//paper///q/\n     GET /course//paper///q/\n     PUT /course//paper///q/\n    POST /course//paper///q/\n  DELETE /course//paper///q/\n    POST /course//paper///q//note\n     GET /course//paper///q//notes\n    POST /course//paper///q//solution\n     GET /course//paper///q//solutions\n     GET /course//paper///q//similar\n     GET /course//popular\n     GET /course/search?q=\n     GET /institution/\n     GET /institution/search?domain=\n    POST /login\n  DELETE /profile/courses/\n     GET /profile/courses/\n   PATCH /profile/courses/\n     GET /static/\n    POST /user\n     PUT /user/\n     GET /user/\nSome notable endpoints:GET /course//paper//.htmlThis endpoint would return the contents of an exam paper converted to HTML on the fly. It was for a old exam paper parser prototype that could let you select the contents of the PDF for extraction. This method worked well until after some testing found the HTML representation of the Exam paper was inaccurate and data was lost.\nGET /course/search?q=The above endpoint would allow the user to search for courses by course code or name.\nGET /course//paper///q//similarThe similar endpoint returned all the questions that were deemed alike to the question specified in the URL.\nBlueprintsEach section of the API is stored in a Blueprint. A Blueprint, in Flask terms, is essentially a container for endpoints that can be dropped into any app. There  is a blueprint for each piece of functionality within the app.Request data validationAs every developer knows, user input is dangerous and must be sanitised before processing. For each endpoint that received data, there was a validation check on the fields in the data and the type of the data sent. The Marshmallow models were reused and were especially useful for PUT requests which allowed for updating of a model. If the data failed validation, a 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY was returned.@app.route(\"/user/\", methods=[\"PUT\"])\n@use_args(schema(User, partial=True))\ndef update_user(id, user):\n    # Update the user\nExceptionsHandling exceptions can become particularly repetitive as the endpoint count goes up because the endpoints are all handling the same types of exceptions (usually from the ORM when a record doesn't exist etc). To break this pattern, the API was taught to understand the exceptions and handle them itself. This was achieved by converting all of the SQL Alchemy exceptions to the project's custom server.exc.HttpException. The HttpException has three properties that the fill out the standard error response (discussed in the API section of the design chapter): code, message and meta. The API will then catch any exceptions raised and respond appropriately.class HttpException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"General purpose HTTP Exception.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, code, message, meta=None):\n        self.code = code\n        self.message = message\n        self.meta = meta\nThe base class for all HttpExceptions.\n\n\n\nThe exceptions can then become as specific as possible to allow for clear code when raising manually. For example, the getBy method raises a server.exc.NotFound when the query to the database doesn't return any results. A request to the following endpoint will fail with a 404 NOT FOUND before it even reaches the respond method if the course parameter doesn't exist.@app.route(\"/course/\")\ndef get_course(course):\n    course = Course.getBy(code=course)\n\n    return respond({ \"course\": course })\nAuthenticationThe user authentication logic exists entirely within the auth.py blueprint in the server/api directory. It can be extracted and planted into any other app (if you take the User and Session models too). The authentication blueprint is relatively simple as far as login modules go however it does everything the application needs of it in it's current state. The Auth blueprint exposes two endpoints:POST /loginThe client will post the username and password of the user attempting to login to this endpoint. The endpoint will verify those details, create a new session object and then return the newly created session object for the client to store in future requests. The token is passed via an Auth-Key custom header.\nGET /authThe client, on startup, will use this endpoint to test if their stored API key is still valid. If it is not valid, the client will redirect the client to the user the login page. Traditionally this step was ignored and a page load was attempted and if it failed, it redirected. This is costly to the server, attempting to load large objects when it's unnecessary. This endpoint simply returns 200 OK standard success response if a valid token was passed, 401 UNAUTHORIZED if not.\nMiddlewareTo simply the checking of user login on each request, some handy middleware was created. The authorize middleware can be put on any route to ensure the client requesting the resource is logged in and authorised. It will also store the loaded user in the request session storage.@app.route(\"/profile\")\n@authorize\ndef get_profile():\n    return respond({ \"profile\": g.user })\nHandling Sensitive User DataTo ensure the maximum security when it came to user details, passwords were hashed with a randomly generated salt and stored in the database. Never in cleartext. Each time the user would try to login, the login would get the user from the database via their email, run the hashing algorithm with the inputted password and the retrieved salt and compare the results.The hash and login implementation on the User model:class User(Model):\n    def login(self, password=None):\n        \"\"\"Log the current user instance in. This does 2 things:\n            1. Compares the password.\n            2.

The implementation for this algorithm is in the course.py in the servers/model directory. The algorithm to compute the similarity of questions is detailed as follows:Get the all the question content for a course.This involves retrieving all the current revisions for all the questions on all papers contained within the course. The operation is quite hefty on the server because of the size of the query to load a question (this could be optimised to a simple SELECT from the question table and JOIN question_revision however). The content of each question is then stored in-memory in an array data structure. It is important to only include questions with content and not group questions that only have an index.\nRemove all stopwords from the question content.A stopword is a word that don't have much significance or impact on the content such as \"the\", \"a\", \"we\", \"it\" etc. The process removes noise from the question content and allows the algorithm to focus on the content that will identify the question.\nCount unique terms.This is the process of converting the word content of the question to vectors to perform statistical analysis on their similarity. The process involves counting all the unique terms $N$ across all the documents (the content of the questions). This process is done via Scikit's CounterVectorizer.\nVectorization and term weighting.This step involves creating a huge 2 dimensional array $N \\times |\\text{Documents}|$. Each  cell represents the $tfidf$ weight of that term in the relation to the entire corpus (all the document). The $tfidf$ weight is the term frequency times the inverse document frequency of that term. Here is the implementation for calculating the $tfidf$. N = len(self.questions)\n tf = lambda document, term: self.documents[document, term]\n df = lambda term: self.documents[:, term].sign().sum()\n idf = lambda term: np.math.log10(float(N) / float(df(term)))\n tfidf = lambda document, term: float(tf(document, term)) * idf(term)\n\nCompute the cosine similarity of every question against the all the question's in the course.\n\nNext, we loop over every document (question) in the corpus (all questions) and compute the cosine_similarity of the document against all the other document vectors in the corpus. The cosine_similarity will return a scalar value that we use to base our similarity.\nMap the similarity vector to the questions.Once the cosine similarity is calculated, we are left with a single dimension array of scalar values whose index corresponds to the document. We zip these two together to create our Similar objects: similarities = []\n for question, similarity in zip(self.questions, similarity_vector)\n     similarities.append(Similar(\n         question_id=query_question.id, \n         similar_question_id=question.id, \n         similarity=similarity\n     ))\nFilter out questions whose similarity is below the SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD and save to database.\n\nMost of the similarity results are in the range of 0.00 to 0.002 which means they're not similar at all. We need to discard that noise and only insert the useful results into the database.\nGetting popular questionsThe app also calculates popular questions within a course using the similarity. It's essentially a complex SQL query that SUMs all the question's similarity when grouped by question_id, then orders by sum of the similarity. You can view the implementation in server/model/course.py.CachingAn extremely important aspect of the web application was the caching layer between the user and the server. Many of the SQL queries were big which caused a lot of strain on the database. Nothing it couldn't handle for one connection but with 100s of requests performing the query every second, it would break slow the app down to a crawl. The caching layer ensured that this wasn't a problem and it was imperative the implementation do the follow:Stay out of the programmers way.\n\nDon't adversely affect debugging or API tests.\n\nAllow for easy expiring of items in the cache.\n\nThe base library for the caching was Flask-Cache. It provided a memoization layer for methods. The layer would hash the function name with it's parameters (__repr__ magic for objects) and store the result in the cache. If the function was called again, it was checked for a cache hit and the cached result returned. To added the memoization layer to a function, a simple @memoize decorator was used and to remove a cached result: delete_memoized.The API added another layer of abstraction to these methods and created the @cache_view middleware for endpoint that would automatically cache the result return from the API. To invalidate the cached view, it was just a matter of calling invalidate_view with the view name.@Course.route(\"/course//popular\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n@cache_view\ndef get_popular(course):\n    course = model.Course.getBy(db.session, code=course.upper())\n\n    return respond({\n        \"course\": course,\n        \"popular_questions\": course.popular_questions\n    })\nThe cache middleware in action on the course endpoint.\n\n\n\nSome precautions had to be taken however to ensure the cache invalidated old data. Whenever a new entity was created or edited, all caches containing the entity had to be expired, like semi-manual garbage collection."},"implementation/frontend.html":{"url":"implementation/frontend.html","title":"Frontend","keywords":"","body":"3.3 FrontendComponent IndexBelow is a list of all the components in the app. All \"dumb\" components are in the views/ui folder and the smart are contained in the views/app and views/parser directories.\n    views/\n    \n        Root\n        app/\n        \n            App, Course, CoursePicker, Dashboard, Logout, Notes, Paper, Question, Solutions, routes\n        \n        pages/\n        \n            Error404, Login, Signup\n        \n        parser/\n        \n            PDFView, Parser, routes\n            panels/\n            \n                HelpPanel, InfoPanel, QuestionsPanel\n            \n        \n        templates/\n        \n            Container, Footer, Header\n        \n        ui/\n        \n            Avatar, Back, Empty, Icon, Institution, Loading, Markdown, Removed\n            comment/\n            \n                Comment, Comments\n            \n            course/\n            \n                CourseLink, CourseList, CoursePlaceholder\n            \n            editor/\n            \n                Editor, Preview, Textarea\n            \n            error/\n            \n                ErrorMessage, ErrorPage\n            \n            input/\n            \n                Button, Field, Form, Input, Select, Textarea\n            \n            layout/\n            \n                Box, Flex, FlexBox, Solid\n            \n            notes/\n            \n                Note, NoteForm, NoteLink, Notes\n            \n            paper/\n            \n                PaperDot, PaperFooter, PaperGrid, PaperInfo, PaperLink\n            \n            parser/\n            \n                Panel\n            \n            question/\n            \n                Marks, Question, QuestionActions, QuestionPath, Questions\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouterThe router is the entry part of the application. The router dictates what components to mount and thus what part of the app to initialise. The router itself is a React component and works much like any other component. It has Route components which describe the URLs and support nesting as you'd expect.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n\nThe App routes configuration.\n\n\n\nIn the above example, all matching components will be rendered as children to the App component (i.e. passed as children prop). If no route is matched, the IndexRoute will match and the Dashboard component will be rendered.Direct linkingAn extremely important part of the application experience is being able to direct link to content and have it load automatically without user interaction. This is trivial to implement (i.e. how they operate) with server-side rendering but a very hard problem in client side apps. The client must decide what to load for the user and how all in a split second when the page loads.React router is able to match a deep linked URL and mount the correct components who once mounted, continue loading the application from the API. It is for this reason that every component that matches a route must be a smart component. Smart components can tell the state what data to load and select it from the state.Back ButtonAnother seemingly simple function that is difficult problem in web applications is navigating back throughout the app's history. With the combination of the state defined UI and React router, the ability to navigate forward and back through history is just a consequence of great design.Smart ComponentsThe concept of smart and dumb components was discussed in the UI section of the \nDesign chapter. In this section, we'll go through some of the concepts in more detail. Smart components are connected via the react-redux bindings. The bindings take two arguments, the state selector and a map of actions that the component will dispatch to mutate the state.connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToActions)(Component)\nState selectorEvery smart component is connected to the state via selectors. Selectors are functions that, given the state object, return the required data to render the view based on the current state. Take for example, the Course component. It selects the course to render from the resource.courses state in it's selector. As a convention, the selector is stored as a static property on the component's class however it is passed as the mapStateToProps parameter in the connect react-redux bindings. The selector receives two parameters, the state and the props passed to the component.class Course extends Component {\n    static selector = (state, { params }) => {\n        return {\n            course: state.resources.courses.find(course => {\n                return course.code === params.course;\n            });\n        };\n    };\n}\nThe course selector picking the current course from the state.\n\n\n\nThere params object comes from React-Router and contains the parameters in the url (/course/:course). The returned object is then mapped to the component's props allowing state data to be accessed via this.props. This selector is run every time the state changes and since the components props changes, it causes a cascading re-render. This is why it's important to have a couple of smart components.State mutationTo mutate or update the state, we use actions. Again, as a convention, the actions map is stored as a static property on the component's class but is passed as the second parameter mapDispatchToActions to the connect react-redux bindings. The actions map contains action creators which are essentially just functions that return simple objects that describe how to update the state. These actions are passed to the reducers. The react-redux binds the dispatch function to the action creators and passes them as props to the component by their key in the map.class Course extends Component {\n    static actions = {\n        selectPaper: model.Paper.selectPaper,\n        comment: model.User.comment\n    };\n}\nThe connect bindingWhen the selector and actions map are created, it's just a matter of passing them to the connect binding from the react-redux. We then export the returned, wrapped component from the binding.export default connect(Course.selector, Course.actions)(Course);\nThe connected Course component from the React Dev Tools panel.\n\n\n\nSaving selections with React's experimental contextThe selectors for connected components became repetitive the further down the router tree you went because each smart component needed to access the same data. This is where the potential was spotted for React's context.React has an experimental feature call context where you can pass data implicitly down the component tree and access it via a property called contextTypes. The contextTypes map specifies the keys to extract from the context and put into the components this.context property.After modifying the react-redux bindings to introduce the context features, selectors could be thinned down and state already selected further up the component tree could be put into the context. It saved a lot of time and keystrokes without introducing unnecessary complexity to the application. See the selectors for the Paper and Question smart components for usage in context (no pun intended).Tests still have to be created for the react-redux fork that includes context but I hope to create a pull request to include the code to the popular repository soon.API CommunicationTo communicate with the API, the new fetch API was utilised (with a polyfill for old browsers and Node). The API class is an abstraction over the fetch API and contains all the methods to communicate with the API. The class is based on a simple idea that works extremely effective:Instance methods are authenticated request methods.\n\nStatic methods are unauthenticated request methods.\n\nYou can therefore create a new API object via new API() and all subsequent requests to the API made via the instance will be authenticated. There are also other methods for creating authenticated instances:API.login(, ).then( api )This method logs the user in via their credentials and if successful, returns a newly authenticated API instance with the users session key.\nAPI.loginWithAuth(  ).then( api )Validate an auth key on the /auth endpoint and return an new authenticated instance if successful.\nThe authenticated API instance is stored in the state and can be accessed whenever authorised data needs to be loaded from the API. See the src/API.js for a full list of methods of communication with the API.Auto-loginA tricky part of the application logic is auto logging in a user who has a valid API key. Before we can auto-login a user, we have to check if their key saved locally is valid. This sounds a lot easier that it is because this is an asynchronous action.This would have been made simple however a design flaw in the React-router makes the implementation more complicated. By design, React Router awaits async transition handlers to complete before rendering anything to the screen or even matching routes further down the routing tree. So if the app were to check if a user's key is valid on the onEnter hook of a router, a white screen would be left hanging since React-router awaits the completion of the async task before rendering anything or even matching further down the routing tree.To account for this, the Root.jsx component goes against the principles of the entire rest of the application. It uses it's own state. It becomes the root component that when mounted, displays a loading screen and checks if the user's key is valid via the API.loginWithAuth API method. If the key is valid, it adds the user to the state and then returns the entire rest of the app as a replacement for the loading screen. The app now has the user already in the state and can continue to function normally. Had the user's key not been valid, the user would simple not exist and the app can perform a synchronous check and redirect to the login page."},"development/version-control.html":{"url":"development/version-control.html","title":"Version Control","keywords":"","body":"4. Development4.1 Version ControlVersion control is a big part of the project. All of the source for the project is version controlled by git. There is no strict workflow implemented for the project since it's a one man team however there were some rules when working with the code.master and develop branches.The master branch always represented a stable, functioning application at any point in time (merge commits only). The develop branch represents the application at any state during development. You can expect to find a buggy app where somethings may be broken and other unfinished.\nBranching for new features or refactors.For each new feature, a new branch is created under the feature name. All code for that feature is contained within that branch. Sometimes some features cannot be developed in isolation, if that is the case a new branch is to be created from develop and merged into develop on completed, then merged into the blocked feature branch. It is often hard to describe the scope of a feature so this is entirely left up to the developer.\nDetail the commit logs.The commit messages should contain enough detail for anyone browsing the history to understand what was updated or added in the changes. This sometimes became tedious and when it did, it breaking the commit up into smaller chunks and committing more often.\nGithubThe entire codebase is hosted on Github. This served as a backup for the repository and facility for third party services to interact with the project. Gitbook, the software that built this book takes the report/ directory from Github, compiles the book and puts it online for anyone to read.

The philosophy was to use tools that increase development speed without too much abstraction. The reasons for the lack of abstraction is for a better understand of the inner workings of the app and to learn as much about the project as possible. This section gives a short overview of the tools used to create the project.Sublime Text and an IDE-less environmentAt the risk of sounding highly pretentious, I enjoy the pureness of using a simple, plain-text editor (with syntax highlighting). The lighting quick Sublime Text works beautifully and stays out of the way allowing the code to take the forefront instead of the plethora of tools, popups and windows that clutter an IDE. All of the code for the project was written iniTerm2 Command LineEverything about this project can be built and run solely from the command line. As the developer of this project, this was an absolutely necessity for streamlining development, distribution and deployment. A good interface usd for the command line was iTerm2, an open source terminal environment. Some of the more useful commands for the project:\n\nCommand\nResult\n\n`$ docker-compose up`\nDeploy the application.\n`$ npm run dev`\nStart the development server with live reloading.\n`$ python init.py`\nStart the python server.\n`$ py.test`\nRun all API tests for the server.\n`$ http localhost:5000/login`\nPerform complex HTTP queries against the server.\n`$ psql exp`\nOpen an SQL query interface to the database.\n`$ git commit -m \"...\"`\nCommit code into the version control.\n\n\nDash & DocumentationTo access documentation in the fastest manner possible, a fantastic application called Dash was used in excess. A simple keyboard shortcut ⌘+⇧+Space would bring up an interface to access all the docsets for the libraries and frameworks used in the project. It saved, with a confident estimation, about 40% of the would-be time spent looking through documentation for the project. This tool was necessary.\n\n\n\nNode.js and npmThe server-side logic for the project was written in Python however Node.js and it's package manager were a major part of the project's toolchain. Most, if not all, of the code transforming, linting and development tools are all written in Javascript for use with Node.js. It is critical to the build step of the client side code. It's sister, npm, is the package manager that installs these tools and runs them via it's npm run-scripts interface.Virtualenv and managing Python's dependenciesPython has a problem with dependencies and its package management system, pip. Unlike how npm works, each dependency is installed in a global location for every Python project. As a consequence, it makes for a painful experience trying to install different versions of the same dependency. For this exact reason, Virtualenv was created. Virtualenv allows you to install dependencies on a project basis where they no longer clash with versions.Chrome and Dev ToolsAnother critical piece of tooling for the project was Chrome and it's Dev Tools. They are unmatched in their feature set, performance and usability. The time saved in debugging using their Source tab is immeasurable and without it, Javascript would be back in the Stone Age (figuratively speaking).Example of debugging a web request within the projects source code with Chrome Dev Tools.\n\n\n\nBabelBabel is a tool that transpiles the next generation language features in the new EMCAScript 2016 specifications down to code that is understood by all the browsers. The EMCA is the Javascript standards body who maintains the specifications for the language. Some examples of the new features that Babel enables the client to use (and are seen throughout the codebase):\n\nFeature\nExample\n\nArrow functions\n`(a, b) => a + b`\nObject destructuring\n`const { a, b } = this.props`\nClasses\n`class MyComp extends Component {}`\nImport system\n`import React, { PropTypes } from \"react\"`\nFunction bind\n`::this.onClick`\n\n\nBabel is imperative to the project and will not function without it.SASSSASS is another transpiler that converts the SASS language, a superset of CSS, to normal CSS. It's a language extension that makes writing it much simpler. SASS implements some very useful, time saving features. All of the CSS in the project is written this way.\n\nFeature\nExample\n\nStatic import system\n`@import \"reset.css\"`\nVariables\n`$theme-danger-color: #ff0000`\nColor functions\n`color: lighten(purple, 20%)`\nMath\n`height: 400px * 0.3`\nNesting rules\n`.MyComponents { a { color: blue; } }`\n\n\nNotable MentionsOther tools which proved extremely useful:psql - PostgreSQL's SQL query interface.\n\npy.test - Py.Test test runner tool. See Testing chapter.\n\n"},"development/workflow.html":{"url":"development/workflow.html","title":"Workflow","keywords":"","body":"4.3 WorkflowThe development workflow the project was designated between a couple of tools. Each of these tools served their own unique process and were fundamental to the process.Clientnpm ScriptsTo run any aspect of the client, the npm run-script facility was used heavily instead of build tool such as Gulp or Grunt. It offered a lightweight way to write the scripts to build the client aswell as running those scripts. For example, to build the production version of the application, the npm script uses the locally installed webpack to build:\"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack\",\n    \"build-production\": \"NODE_ENV=production npm run build\"\n}\nAnd to run, navigate to the client/ directory and execute:$ npm run build-production\nWebpackWebpack is how the client side is bundled together into a single file. Webpack takes the dependency tree and creates an environment in the browser where all they dependencies are imported correctly and synchronously. The unminified build of the application collects over 1200+ separate Javascript files and combines them into a single, huge 3mb worth of code file. Serving the javascript in that form is a serious user experience failure because of the load time before anything is shown on the screen. The following optimisations have yet to be added:Using production builds of the libraries.\n\nMinification.\n\nRemove development and debugging code.\n\nGoogle closure compiler.\n\nThis process should cut the size of the code down by half and then other techniques such as gzipping and code-splitting (loading the code on demand) should bring it down to a reasonable size.Hot ReloadingBuilding and refreshing the page becomes very tedious when trying to develop components deep down within multiple layers of user interaction in the app. This is where Hot Module Replacement feature in Webpack is works a dream. With a local development server, Webpack will watch for changes in the file system, pick up any changes made to the application and send down the newly updated module over a socket to the app to update in realtime. The React Hot Module Reloader builds on this technology to allow components to update their render methods and perform a re-render, all while maintaining the application tree and state. It's essentially a highly complicated live-reloading technique for modern Javascript applications.To start the client development server with hot reloading, run the following command:$ npm run dev\nThe tools combined, working concurrently on the home workstation.\n\n\n\nServerThe workflow of the server was fairly simple. First, we had to enter the virtualenv of the project. On the local machine, this was called fyp. Using the workon command, the project's virtualenv was activated and all dependencies required for the project would resolve correctly.$ workon fyp\nAs you will read later in the Deployment chapter, the server requires environment variables to understand how to connect to the database and othe configuration. The standard practice is to create a .env file in the server directory (that's not checked into source control) and specify the contents of the variable. We use the export function to persist the variables for the current shell session.

This is especially true with databases. New features often require storing new data of unknown format and the database must adapt to the new requirements. This is where we introduce database migrations. This is a practice seen in large scale application deployment where an existing database needs to be upgraded to a different schema.This project uses the migration tool Alembic. Its based on the SQL Alchemy library and authored by the same person. Alembic is essentially version control for you database. Each time a model is updated in the server, Alembic will detect the differences from the existing database and auto-generate the SQL to migrate the schema to the newly defined schema. These migrations are stored in the server/migrations/versions folder as python files.$ cd server/migrations/\n$ alembic history\n27d9b0a51afe -> ad04219e530a (head), Notes table.\neadd37a9a581 -> 27d9b0a51afe, Adding is_section flag to question model.\ncf2e840ef9ee -> eadd37a9a581, Question similarity.\nf724ae8ee68a -> cf2e840ef9ee, New entity inheritance model and migrating questions.\n4c21720db4f0 -> f724ae8ee68a, Questions and revisions.\n6598bfa4b4e8 -> 4c21720db4f0, Adding PDF paper downloads and conversion to HTML.\n3e4c70155c23 -> 6598bfa4b4e8, Adding unique constraint to table.\n009921b01ab6 -> 3e4c70155c23, Paper table.\n9633df0d8a5e -> 009921b01ab6, Adding courses.\n -> 9633df0d8a5e, Users, sessions and institutions.\nThe version history of the database with Alembic.\n\n\n\nThe models in the project changed often and migrations tool was great for providing some     piece of mind with the data. It ensured data integrity and the database was reliably migrated. Most of the time, each modification to the database could be done by running:However, there were times when the new schema clashed with the existing data. Alembic was especially useful when migrating existing questions to the entity inheritance model.Migrating to the Entity Inheritance ModelA pivotal point in the evolution of the database design was when the Entity inheritance model was introduced. The new design changes were especially severe on the question table which, at the time, stored each question individually with their own id.The question table design before the entity inheritance model.\n\n\n\nWith the new entity inheritance model, things that needed the comment and like functionality needed to become an entity.The question table design after the entity inheritance model was implemented.\n\n\n\nTo convert the existing questions in the question table, each question now had to create an ID within the entity table to satisfy the foreign key. This by itself would have made it a simple upgrade because it's just a one-to-one mapping however the question table also a self-referential column parent_id to allow for nesting. This made the upgrade a little tricky. It required traversing up the question tree to finding the root questions, migrating those to the entity table and then moving each child individually while also keeping track of their parents. The full migration implementation is in server/migrations/versions/cf2e840ef9ee_.py.\n    Alembic was used to time-travel back to the database state before the entity inheritance model was implemented to generate the ER Diagram seen above.\n\n\n"},"development/deploying.html":{"url":"development/deploying.html","title":"Deploying","keywords":"","body":"4.5 DeployingDeploying apps in an efficient, automated and contained environment is an extremely hard problem to solve. There are many points of failure and huge effort is required to ensure the process is reliable and fault tolerant. Although this project had no users as of time of writing, best practices for large scale application deployment were used to ensure a streamlined process from not just a development perspective, but also as a user of the application.Deployment SolutionsThe deployment process is much like setting up the testing pipeline in continuous integration. There were a few deployment strategies tested:Manual deployment.This involved SSH'ing into a server and manually running all commands necessary to setup the application environment, individually. These commands installed all the dependencies for the application such as Python, Nginx, PostgresSQL; moving all the required files to the server for the application (source code, configuration files, assets, database dump); configuring, starting, maintaining and monitoring the services such as the database and webserver.This approach is unscalable and very error prone because it relies too much on the admin. The admin is a literal dependency for the server because any errors or exceptions must be fixed by the admin manually.\nManaged Deployment.A managed deployment is when you let a third party service manage your services for you. You specify your infrastructure in a configuration file and the service will setup and manage the requirements for you. These services are usually paid and require little effort to get running however run into problems when scaling or custom configuration is required. The Heroku platform was tested as a deployment method for the app. The setup and deployment process for the python app was beautifully simple. It was simply a matter of  heroku create in the root of the app and the git push heroku master for live deployment. This was a preferred method but ultimately deemed to expensive.\nSemi-managed DeploymentAnother method briefly tested was using a semi-managed infrastructure which is an amalgamation of manual and managed deployment. You connect with a third-party service which creates and manages the services required for your application but leaves it up to the admin to configure and deploy the application. A semi-managed solution tested was using Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an EC2 (T2) server, an RDS (M) PostgreSQL master database server with Amazon S3 for user uploads and Route 53 for traffic management.*Example infrastructure diagram on AWS for Examist created with CloudCraft.*\n\n\nContainer based deploymentThe final deployment solution tested (and chosen) was container based deployment. Container based deployment is where you create your application in an isolated environment (called a \"container\") with the understanding that the environment will be replicated exactly anywhere the application is deployed. The container is created locally in essentially the same process as manual deployment where all application dependencies and resources are installed and copied to the container however this process only needs to be completed once. The container is then built, created and deployed anywhere. The software of choice for the containerization is Docker.\nDockerDocker is a full stack container management suite that helps with the building, creating, managing and deploying of containers. The concept behind docker is that every container starts with a base image (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) and from there the application is built. Base images can be built from other existing images and the published to a central repository called Docker Hub. This make creating containers fantastically easy. For example, creating an application to serve static content is as simple as doing docker -P run nginx which downloads the offical Nginx image, copys the contents of the current directory to the container and starts the server. The -P flag maps the ports on the container to random ports on the host machine (useful for development) so if port 80 on the container is mapped to 44783 on the host, you could navigate to :44783 and view your static content.Building the application containerDocker also introduces the concept of Dockerfiles. These are files that describe how to build your application's container by specifying commands to run within the container and \"committing\" the results. Below is our server Dockerfile which runs the Flask based python server (some commands to fix dependency specific errors are omitted).FROM python:2.7\n\n# Install Python dependency\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get -y install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools \\\n        python-numpy python-scipy \\\n        libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-base\n\n# Copy our server code\nCOPY ./server /usr/src/server\nWORKDIR /usr/src/server\n\n# Install the server's dependencies and itself\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nRUN pip install .\n\n# Start the server\nCMD [\"python\", \"init.py\"]\n\n    The Python base image is just another Dockerfile that inherits from a base linux distribution and installs Python 2.7.\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, our container inherits from the python:2.7 base image. This gives us a base Python 2.7 installation for us to use to run our server. The server itself has a large list of dependencies (33 altogether) which all need to be installed to run it. Two of these dependencies, Scipy and Numpy, are particulary large and very resource heavy to install manually so we install them via the package manager apt-get. This small optimization saves a huge amount of time when building our containers. We install these two outliers first (and they depend on the other specify packages) using the RUN Docker command.Next, we copy over our server's source to the container with the COPY command. This embeds the source code within the container so anywhere the container is deployed, the code goes with it. Once the source is copied over, we install all the dependencies specified in our server's requirements.txt via pip install -r requirements.txt. This process is quite lengthy because it has to download and setup each dependency. Finally, once the server's dependencies are installed, we install the server itself as if it were a package. By installing the server like this, it allows any code to import server.* and use the Flask app and SQL Alchemy models from anywhere.These commands, in sequence, describe how we build our container for our app but do nothing by themselves. We send them to Docker who actually builds the container:$ docker build -t examist-server .\nStep 1 : FROM python:2.7\n ---> e4a554df875e\nStep 2 : RUN apt-get update\n ---> 335926fb1abf\nRemoving intermediate container eh202h2g1k96\nStep 3 : RUN apt-get -y install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools         python-numpy python-scipy         libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-base\n ---> 3b1a874caf1d\nRemoving intermediate container 3hd8b39dlsl1\nStep 4 : RUN update-alternatives --set libblas.so.3       /usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so.3;     update-alternatives --set liblapack.so.3       /usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/liblapack.so.3\n ---> 10255ef80cba\nRemoving intermediate container caayi211080h\nStep 5 : RUN bash -c 'ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/{numpy,scipy}* /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/'\n ---> c8e6f37b81ef\nRemoving intermediate container dshfd4afddsf\nStep 6 : COPY ./server /usr/src/server\n ---> d9bb2171845b\nRemoving intermediate container 342d4a6075bc\nStep 7 : WORKDIR /usr/src/server\n ---> Running in a001050fc986\n ---> 6de9388fde45\nRemoving intermediate container a001050fc986\nStep 8 : RUN pip install -U -r requirements.txt\n ---> Running in 7dd492f5d5aa\n...\n ---> 9f9aab0151b7\nSuccessfully built 9f9aab0151b7\nAs you can see from the output above, Docker takes each command from the Dockerfile, runs it and generates our container image 9f9aab0151b7 (which we also tagged with the -t flag as examist-server). In programming terms, the container image is the class and the container is the instance of that container image.Notice someting very interesting about how Docker creates the final container image. Each RUN command takes the previous image (all the way back to FROM, which specifies the base image), creates a new container from that image, runs the command in that container then generates a new image based on the updated filesystem for use in the following RUN command. It's a stack based system that creates our final application container image ready to deploy.Deployment of a container image is as simple as docker run . This will create a new container and executes the CMD from our Dockerfile. As long as our CMD process is running, the Docker container will continue to run. Our server's Dockerfile starts our python Flask app by running python init.py:$ docker run examist-server\n* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nOther ServicesThe server container is just the standalone Python Flask server. That isn't enough to run the whole app because it needs a frontend file server and database also to function correctly. We create two more, seperate containers for each of these services. Below is a brief overview:Database containerThe database container inherits from the postgres:9 base image which comes pre-installed with PostgreSQL, creates our default users (roles) and automatically executes any SQL files copied to a special /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ when the container is created. Our Dockerfile looks like:FROM postgres:9\n\nARG dump\nCOPY ./data/dumps/$dump /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\nWe have a special ARG command which allows build-time arguments to be passed to the Dockerfile. In our database's Dockerfile, we pass in the name of the database dump we want to copy to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ so we can always specify the latest dump.Client containerThe client container inherits from the nginx base image which installs Nginx, a high performance load balancer, web server and reverse proxy. Nginx is what faces the outside world and handles how each request should be handled by the server. We use Nginx to serve our client files (index.html, the javascript and CSS) on the root domain and also pass on any requests to the API onto the Flask Server, internally. The Dockerfile for out client:FROM nginx\n\n# Copy the client source code\nCOPY ./client /usr/src/client\n# Copy our Nginx configuration\nCOPY ./client/nginx.conf /usr/src/client/nginx.conf\n\nENV NGINX_ENV_REPLACE '$DOMAIN'\nCMD /bin/bash -c \"envsubst '$NGINX_ENV_REPLACE'  /etc/nginx/conf.d/client.conf && cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/client.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'\"\n\nEnvironmentsOut of the box, these containers don't know how to communicate with each other so without some configuration, they're pretty much useless. We could add the configuration during the build process in our Dockerfile however this is bad practice and ruins the contained aspect of the containers because hardcoding configuration is highly dependant on deployment environment (the anti-thesis of Docker).Instead of hardcoding our configuration, we specify it on the fly using environment variables. These are named values passed to containers at runtime that are then passed down to any processes running within the container i.e. our apps. If we take our server container for example and it's configuration file:from os import environ as env\n\nDB_USER = env[\"DB_USER\"]\nDB_PASS = env[\"DB_PASS\"]\nDB_HOST = env.get(\"DB_HOST\", \"localhost\")\nDB_PORT = int(env.get(\"DB_PORT\", 5432))\nDB_NAME = env[\"DB_NAME\"]\nThe server's config requires three environment variables DB_USER, DB_PASS and DB_NAME (otherwise the app won't start) and two other optional variables which have sensible defaults. These variables tell the server how to connect to the database which resides in a totally different container. We pass them in like so:$ docker run -e DB_USER=postgres \\\n    -e DB_PASS=postgres \\\n    -e DB_NAME=exp \\\n    examist-server\nThis will configure our environment with those values and start the server. If we were to open a shell in the container and look at the value of $DB_USER, we would find the value postgres. Passing values like this at runtime also has the great security advantage over configuring at build time. Any passwords or sensitive keys are not hardcoded into the container image which could be accidentally distributed and dissected easily.Composing our servicesNow we have three standalone, configurable containers with no configuration so they don't know how to communicate with each other just yet. The final concept to be introduced is Docker Compose. Docker compose is a tool that will take an input configuration file docker-compose.yml which specifies each services and their environments, builds, creates and deploys them on the same network. It does a lot of other cool stuff under the hood to make communication between them as easy as possible. The docker-compose.yml for our application:services:\n  server:\n    build: \n      dockerfile: ./deploy/server.docker\n    environment:\n      DB_NAME: exp\n      DB_USER: postgres\n      DB_PASS: postgres\n      DB_HOST: db\n      APP_PORT: 5000\n      APP_HOST: \"0.0.0.0\"\n    links: \n      - db\n    expose:\n      - 5000\n  client:\n    build: \n      dockerfile: ./deploy/client.docker\n    environment:\n      DOMAIN: examist.xyz\n    links:\n      - server\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n  db:\n    build: \n      dockerfile: ./deploy/db.docker\n      args:\n        dump: exp-03042016-1803.sql\n    expose:\n      - 5432\nTake a look at our db service first. We specify our dump file as a build time argument that will create the database container with the given dump. We also have an expose attribute with a value of 5432. This is the default port Postgres listens on and we expose that port on the db container so that any containers on the same network can access the db via the port.\n    The postgres base image creates a default user \"postgres\" with the password \"postgres\". The \"exp\" database comes from our database dump. This is where we get the values you see for the environment variables in the server service. \n\n\n\n\nOur next and most important service is the server. The server requires the database so we add a link to it's service. The link tells Docker that the db service is a dependency of the server service and will start (or re-build or re-create) the db service anytime the server service is started (or updated). We pass in our environment variables that will allow the server to connect to the database and expose the port 5000, the application's port.Docker Compose also has the handy feature of adding the names of the linked services to the hosts file of each dependant service which points to the linked container in the network. For example, since the server service depends on the db service, it's possible to access the database container from within the server container by postgresql://db:5432 (as long as the correct ports are EXPOSE'd also, like we did above). This explains the \"db\" as the value for the DB_HOST environment variable in the server service configuration.Our final service is the client service which depends on the server service (and thus db). We specify it's configuration as environment variables, the DOMAIN indicates the domain Nginx will accept connections on. We also have a ports attribute which specify how the outside world can access the container. All the other containers are only accessible from within the container network however the ports attribute allows us to map a port on the host machine to a port on the network. For our application, we map the port 80 on the host machine to access port 80 on the client container.Once the configuration is setup, we pass it onto docker-compose up to start all the services correctly in-line with the dependency tree. Now we have the full application up and running on :80!$ docker-compose up\nStarting deploy_db_1\nStarting deploy_server_1\nStarting deploy_client_1\nAttaching to deploy_db_1, deploy_server_1, deploy_client_1\nDeployingNow for the easy part, actually pushing our containers to a server. We could opt to allocate a physical (or virtual) server for each service however that would be expensive and unnecessary at this scale. Instead, we opt to deploy the three containers to a single server on DigitalOcean.Before now, Docker works on a \"host machine\" via docker-machine. This is the host computer itself (or a VM running inside the host computer) which docker sends it's commands to. This is not to be confused with a container itself. The host machine is an abstraction to allow docker to deploy anywhere, it doesn't discriminate between machines which allows admins to switch between machines and contexts with great ease. For example, on OSX, Docker isn't fully supported on top of the main OS so a VM is spawned via Virtualbox and sets up a Docker environment within the VM. Any command we run thereafter is run inside the VM and not on the host OS as you'd expect. Now, if you want to deploy to a remote server, you simply switch the VM for the remote server and you are now deploying to live production.With this in mind, we create our DigitalOcean server which conveniently has creating \"machines\" on DigitalOcean built right into docker (as a driver):$ docker-machine create \\\n    --driver digitalocean \\\n    --digitalocean-access-token  \\\n    examist-app\nNow we have our machine (or \"Droplet\" as DigitalOcean calls it) created, we need to ensure that commands will be sent to this machine. The machine you deploy to is specified by DOCKER_HOST environment variable (on the host computer environment where you run the commands, not the container environment) that is connected to every time you run a command. The docker-machine utility has a handy command to setup environments automatically for you via eval $(docker-machine env ). With this in mind, we setup our DigitalOcean's machine to work:$ eval $(docker-machine env examist-app)\nAnd to complete our deployment, we run docker-compose up -d to run start the containers in detached mode:$ docker-machine up -d\nNow our application is available online on DigitalOcean's servers! All that's left now is to point our domain to the IP allocated for our server and the application is successfully running online.Lessons LearnedAlthough the deployment process itself is extremely smooth, reaching that point was not. There was many obscure bug that took hours to get past:The Flask application does not expose itself on the internal container network when in debug mode. This made for an extremely frustrating hidden bug that wasted countless hours trying to understand why Nginx was giving Bad Gateway errors when trying to forward traffix. It was fixed by taking the app out of debug mode by ensuring the APP_DEBUG environment variable resolved to False.\nNginx does not support having environment variables in it's config file and the suggested utility by the Docker repository is envsubst to replace variables in the form of $varname inside the configuration text file (essentially hardcode the values). Nginx's internal variables which conveniently are also in the form of $varname which the configuration used to add CORS support. envsubst would just remove the variables it couldn't substitute, leaving a blank space where the original, Nginx variable reference would be. When starting, Nginx would just output that the configuration is broken. To ensure envsubst didn't remove the internal variables, you could specify a second parameter to envsubst with a colon seperated list of values to replace. Since $DOMAIN was the only environment variable used in the Nginx configuration file envsubst '$DOMAIN' should have been enough to fix it however this was not the case. Due to how we ran the client's container CMD within a bash -c \"\", bash would substitute variables of the form $varname within double quotes to anything in the environment. This lead to an extremely frustrating and taxing debugging session where the first unintended substitution by bash was discovered. To fix it, we had to stick the name of the variable (unsubtituted) into another variable and use it as the varible name within envsubst. It's quite hard to wrap your head around.  ENV NGINX_ENV_REPLACE '$DOMAIN'\n  CMD /bin/bash -c \"envsubst '$NGINX_ENV_REPLACE' \\\n       /etc/nginx/conf.d/client.conf\"\n\n"},"testing/test-design.html":{"url":"testing/test-design.html","title":"Test Design","keywords":"","body":"5. Testing5.1 Test DesignPrecautions were taken to ensure the tests for the project were reliable and consistent. Ensuring that good tests were easy to write was also a huge part of the philosophy behind testing in the project.BackendThe API has a large suite of tests to ensure any changes to models or blueprints don't break anything. Whenever a change is made to any part of the codebase, the entire suite of tests must be run to check each endpoint is returning the data is supposed to. For each endpoint within the app, there is an average of 3 tests that ensure to test three things:A request with invalid parameters fails.These are usually POST or PUT requests that send data to the server. The body of these requests must follow a strict schema and each field must have the correct data type. This includes parameters within the endpoint's URL itself. These tests are designed for security purposes to prevent SQL injection and meddling with parameters that are not publicly accessible.\nA request with invalid data fails.Again, these are usually POST or PUT requests that send data to the server intending to be processed in some way. The endpoint has to be tested to ensure the integrity of the existing data is not compromised by incoming valid data. Examples are when trying to create new users when an email already exists for that user or trying to update an entity that violates a constraint within the database.\nThe response returned the correct data.Probably the most important test of the three is that given a valid request, the API returns the expected data. This is to ensure that interfaces built for the API can trust the server to always return data in the same format and structure.\nFixturesThe key to testing an application is making it easy to write good tests. Tests should be simple, complete and deterministic. When writing a test takes longer than writing the implementation of the code being tested, something is wrong. To avoid that trap and make writing tests as easy as possible for the API, the test suite made heavy use of Py.Test fixtures.Fixtures are methods, that when called, perform some setup for the test suite. This includes connecting the database, creating the tables, importing sample data and generally laying down the foundations for tests so that they can act upon real data.The fixtures are designed to have zero side effects. This means that any database commits or file changes always rollback their changes to the initial state. Now, every time a fixture is required, the test can expect a clean slate. Fixtures can be scoped to the \"session\" or \"function\". The session scope turns the fixture into a singleton that when required first is executed and all following uses have the same value. This is useful for setting up the database connection and creating the tables which needs to be done only once per testing session. The function scope forces the fixture to be executed every time a test unit requires the fixture, this is useful for using SQL Alchemy's Session object and rollback any changes made to the database during that test.Sample Testdef test_profile_delete_course(auth_client, user_with_courses, session):\n    existingCourse = user_with_courses.courses[0]\n    resp = auth_client.delete(\"/profile/courses\", \n        data={ \"course\": existingCourse.id })\n\n    assert_api_success(resp)\n\n    session.refresh(user_with_courses)\n    assert len(user_with_courses.courses) == 4\n    assert not find(user_with_courses.courses, \n        lambda mod: mod.id == existingCourse.id)\nAbove we have an example test test_profile_delete_course which sends a request to the API attempting to remove a course from a user's associated courses. From the method arguments, we can see it uses three fixtures (Py.Test automatically resolves the arguments to fixtures when it runs the test): auth_client, user_with_courses and session (for a full list of fixtures, see Appendix 1: Test Fixtures).The auth_client provides an API client that has a logged in session and user associated with it and any requests made are authorised. This saves the hassle of having to write login code for every test (if I wanted an unauthorised client, I'd ask for the client fixture). The user_with_courses fixture returns a user with courses associated at \"function\" scope and committed to the database. Finally, the session object is an SQL Alchemy Session object we can use to query the database to ensure any changes made by the API exist in the database.The first two lines of the test used the auth client to make a DELETE request to /profiles/courses with the ID of a course that a user has associated. We want to remove that course from the user's associated courses.Next, we assert_api_success which checks that the API returned a 200 OK and the standard success response. If it doesn't, it will raise an AssertionError and the test will fail. Finally, we make sure the change has persisted to the database by refreshing the User entity and ensuring the course is not associated anymore.When the test is complete, everything is rolled back to the state before the test started including the user's login session created for the auth_client and the new user and their courses created in the user_with_courses. If any following tests require those fixtures, everything has to be recommitted to the database from scratch again. This may seem cumbersome and slow however it is the best way to ensure that every test will not be negatively affected by unintended side effects.AssertionsThe application implements a suite of custom assertions specifically tailored to the API. In line with the principle of making good tests easy to write, there are three methods:assert_api_error( response, status_code [, message, meta ] )This method takes an API response from the client and asserts that a HTTP error response was returned that matches status_code. The method also allows for testing the contents of the error message and the schema of the meta object.\nassert_api_success( resp )This method takes asserts the API has returned a 200 OK and matches the standard success API response.\nassert_api_response( resp )The assert_api_response method asserts we have a 200 OK returned from the API. It also serves another purpose of parsing the JSON response and yielding the object: def test_resp(client):\n     resp = client.get(\"/courses\")\n\n     with assert_api_response(resp) as data:\n         assert \"courses\" in data\n         assert len(data[\"courses\"] > 5)\n\nLoggingSince the development workflow of the backend is mostly TDD (Test Driven Development), it's important that the output and logs of the code being tested is easily accessible to ensure the code is performing as it should. For the test suite, a lot of effort was put into ensuring the log output was as readable and approachable as possible. There was a couple of steps involved in reach the current state.First off, Py.test does a poor job of reporting test execution. By default it suppresses any output unless the command line flag -s is enabled. Even with that, only a period is outputted after the test has completed execution. The first change to the output was to mark the beginning and end of a test run using large, guarded markers with the test name.The next modification to the logging output was making SQL Alchemy's SQL output readable. This was no easy task because SQL Alchemy spits out huge chunks, line by line which leads to unparseable walls of text. SQL Alchemy uses Python's native logging module which allows you to plug in your own formatters and filters. The SQL Alchemy logger was modified to colorise, indent and pad the queries with any parameters displayed just below.Finally, the last modification was only logging data that was relevant to the test. The fixtures produce a lot of output such as SQL queries and any other function call and created large chunks of text before the test even started running. Py.Test unfortunately did not have the facility to turn off output from fixtures so a custom solution has to be built. From deep within the Py.Test docs, I found two \"hooks\" which would call a method before and after each test run called (pytest_runtest_call, pytest_runtest_teardown). From there, it was simply a matter of turning on and off the output from any loggers and isolate only the test output."},"testing/continuous-integration.html":{"url":"testing/continuous-integration.html","title":"Continuous Integration","keywords":"","body":"5.2 Continuous IntegrationAs part of the development and testing process, it is important to run tests as often as possible to ensure no parts of the app are broken as a consequence of some change. As the test suite grows, so does the time it takes to run the tests. If the tests are being ran after each change, the development process is being slowed down. With Continuous Integration, this testing overhead is removed and offloaded to a third party.CodeshipCodeship is a third party service that setups up the test environment for application and runs the test suites. If the tests fail, a notification is sent to the developer with a link to the problem. Tests are run in response to code pushes to the remote repository. For example, if a breaking change was made to API that broke some tests and committed it. After a push:$ git push origin my-feature\nAn email would be received with a notification detailing that the tests were broken and that they needed to be fixed."},"results.html":{"url":"results.html","title":"Results","keywords":"","body":"6. ResultsThe product of all the hard work put into this Final Year Project is a fully functioning online application that is accessible via:http://examist.xyz\n\n\n\nAnyone can create an account, log in and get started adding their courses. Users can start to transcribe their papers and build the question index for modules. In other words, the application is useful.FeaturesThe features that were implemented are listed below (not a comprehensive list):Single page application.\n\nUser accounts.\n\nPick your own courses.\n\nView popular questions in a course.\n\nView exam papers.\n\nGet external links to PDF.\n\nComment on questions.\n\nPost notes to questions.\n\nView similar for questions.\n\nInto the FutureThe future for the project is to hopefully make it available online for all students to help solve the problem of accessing exam papers and their solutions. The content of the application relies on users for it's crowd sourced content so without them, it's lifeless.Once enough exam papers are transcribed, hopefully that will create enough data to allow for machine learning algorithms to take over and be trained to automatically and accurately extract the questions from the paper.From there, the application should be opened to all forms of institutions. Other colleges, the Leaving Cert and any courses with exams could be made available on the system to allow the system to grow and understand users.After course data is collected, topic clouds could be generated to give users an overview of certain courses and disciplines. Automatically link similar courses between colleges and materials to create a truly open and sharing learning environment.When multiple courses from different colleges are collected, exam papers could be generated by extracting related questions to test the users themselves in preparation for the real exam.Screenshots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source ContributionsAll of the software used in the creating of this application is open source and it is unfair to only take without giving. Here are some of the contributions to the open source this project had:1 release library: redux-pending - https://github.com/adriancooney/redux-pending\n\nFiling bugs & issues:https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues/275\n\nhttps://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues/289#issuecomment-201638203\n\n\nStack overflow answers:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35625834/ebook-convert-spits-out-python-error-can-someone-understand-the-error/36377027#36377027\n\n\n"},"conclusions.html":{"url":"conclusions.html","title":"Conclusions","keywords":"","body":"ConclusionThis project was without a doubt the biggest learning experience of my Computer Science career. Many new concepts were struggled with, understood and perfected throughout the course of the project. An estimated 400 hours were sunk into the conception, development and implementation time of the project.Execution of the conceptPersonally, I feel as though the application in it's current states does fulfils the main goal of the project, an online platform to access exam paper and collaborate with fellow coursemates. It indeed is missing a couple of features due to time constraints however there was no technical challenge too great. It was only the limitations imposed by circumstance and environment (e.g. the exam papers in PDF format) that forced the project to evolve beyond some requirements laid out in the initial project definition document.Closing wordLooking back on the entire project, it was a fantastic experience. The amount of new knowledge acquired is immeasurable along with the newfound understanding of personal capabilities. The project concept was not chosen because it was easy, but in fact the opposite. It was chosen because it was difficult and I would have to exceed my personal limitations to get results.Apologies for any frustrating formatting errors. I took a chance doing this report in a new service call Gitbook which publishes the report online and in many formats. It's buggy in places and comes with the sacrifice of many formatting."},"references.html":{"url":"references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"ReferencesAbramov, D. (2016).

See formal defintion below of a question.DeviationsSectionsSome exam papers, for example CH140 Engineering Chemistry, Paper 1 Written, 2014/2015 are split into sections.Exam Question SpecificationTypes of questions1. Simple questionA simple question is a single or multi line text blurb. It does not have to end with a question mark. It does not require an index. It can follow with marks for the question in the form of (X), [X] or any variant.Definition:simple_question = [blurb] mark?\nmark = round_mark / square mark\nround_mark = \"(\" [0-9]+ \")\"\nsquare mark = \"[\" [0-9]+ \"]\"\nExample:How did the arsonist get round shaped feet? (20)\n2. Multiple Choice QuestionA multiple choice question is a simple question followed by an indexed list of answers. For types of indexing, see below.Definition:multiple_choice_question = simple_question answer+\nanswer = index [blurb] mark?\nExample:How many questions is there in a short question question? (2)\n    (a) This answer.\n    (b) OR this answer.\n    (c) OR, HEY LISTEN, this answer.\nThis allows us to define question:question = multiple_choice_question / simple_question\n3. Indexed QuestionAn indexed question is a question that has an index. For types of indexing, see below.Definition:indexed_question = index question\nExamples:A. How many example questions would a question like this have? (5)\nB. How many marks should a question like this be worth? (5)\nC. What time is it? (20)\n4. List questionA list question is a question that has mutiple sub-questions. A blurb header describes the question or gives instructions on how to answer the sub-questions. Sub-questions are a list of indexed questions. A list question can also have an index.Defintion:list_question = index? simple_question indexed_question+\nExample:N. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, et amet iudico alterum vim, ea pro molestie copiosae mediocritatem. Ei has graeci percipitur mediocritatem, eius illum omnes te sea. Mei accusata adversarium at, cetero impetus prodesset vis ea. Sit amet moderatius ad.\n\n    A. How many example questions would a question like this have? (5)\n    B. How many marks should a question like this be worth? (5)\n        (a) This answer.\n        (b) OR this answer.\n        (c) OR, HEY LISTEN, this answer.\n    C. What time is it? (20)\nIndexingIndexing in exam papers is highly inconsistent. Questions can use different forms of numbering within the same exam paper.Decimal - Usually for the main questions.\n\nLetters (A, b) - Normally for sub questions or multiple choice, uppercase or lowercase.\n\nRoman (i, ii, iii) - Normally for sub questions\n\nDefinition:index = prefix? round_index / square_index / dot_index / types\n\nprefix = \"Question\" / \"Q.\" / \"Q\"\n\nround_index = \"(\" types \")\"\nsquare_index = \"[\" alphabet \"]\"\ndot_index = types \".\"\n\ntypes = demical / alphabet / roman\n\ndecmial = [0-9]+\nalphabet = [a-zA-Z]\nroman = [roman numeral]\nExamples:a.\nA.\n(A)\n[1]\nQ1\nQuestion 1\nQuestion i\niii\niv\n"}}}
